# interwiki
A small script I use every day to change the current page URL in Vimperator
(Firefox) to switch between French and English Wikipedia, go to the last
version of (Python|Java|Boost|Whatever) documentation when Google gives an old
version etc.

## Usage
I use it in Vimperator [that way][1].

## Why *interwiki*
Because I initialy made it to switch between French and English Wikipedia.
